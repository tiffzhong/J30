      //------------
      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      console.log(players, team); // both: ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"]
      // team[3] = "lux";
      // console.log(players, team); // both: ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "lux"]

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();
      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      console.log(team3);
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      console.log(team4);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
      console.log(cap2);
      //this is making a copy of the original object.

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer"
        }
      };

      console.clear();
      console.log(wes);

      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
      //creates it into a string then back into an object for deep level access
